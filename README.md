# Project Title



Interactive Photo Gallery



## How It Works



- In it's default state, the webpage shows all of the images inside the gallery



- When the user enters a string of letters into the search bar the content inside the gallery gets filtered



  - _Only the images whose caption matches the entered text will be visible. The other images will be hidden_



- When the user clicks on a specific image, a larger version of the image is displayed and buttons to navigate through the images gets added to the display (this is done using a lightbox library)



### Goal of the project



- To build an interactive photo gallery that filters it's contents based on user input

- To use an external (lightbox) library to accelarate the development phase
